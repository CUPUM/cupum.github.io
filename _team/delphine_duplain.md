Delphine Duplain is a professional with a background in urban planning and design.  With five years of hands-on experience in Cambodia, Delphine has worked on a range of conservation and education initiatives, from the remote island of Koh Seh to the bustling city of Phnom Penh. She began her career by mapping the ocean floor off the coast of Kep, later shifting her focus to educational projects that leverage the power of games to engage and inform.

Currently, Delphine works as a Research Agent at the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape, where she coordinates the annual UNESCO Studio. In addition, she teaches game design at the Design School of the University of Montr√©al. Her work continues to bridge the gap between theory and practice, focusing on urban issues and their impact on communities.
