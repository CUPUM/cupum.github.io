[Hugo Berard](hugo.berard@umontreal.ca) is a postdoctoral researcher at the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape at the University of Montréal. He holds a PhD in computer science from Mila, where he applied game theory to AI to develop and improve image generation algorithms. Reflecting on the environmental and social impacts of AI, he shifted his research toward creating responsible AI systems that are rooted in local initiatives and address community needs. His work prioritizes co-design and co-construction methodologies, fostering meaningful collaboration between citizens and diverse stakeholders. He is particularly interested in the intersection of AI and participatory democracy, exploring how AI can enable new forms of citizen participation, allowing people to actively engage in decision-making at the local level.

He is deeply committed to addressing social and environmental challenges. As an active member of Mila’s sustainability committee, he advocates for reducing AI’s environmental footprint and promoting sustainable practices in the field. He is also a facilitator for La Fresque du Climat, leading workshops to help communities better understand and address the impacts of climate change.
