Sarah earned her Bachelor’s degree in Landscape Architecture (B.LA) from the American University of Beirut (AUB), in Lebanon. After working as a research assistant on various social projects aimed at promoting Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI), she decided to pursue her master’s degree in Environmental Design (M.Sc.A) at the Université de Montréal. 

Her master’s thesis, developed at the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape, and with the financial support of OBVIA (The International Observatory on the Societal Impacts of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Technologies), explored how the rise of AI in urban environments impacts citizens’ mental health; particularly focusing on those who have anxiety and depression. Sarah also worked as a communications agent and research assistant at the UNESCO Chair for over three years. 
 
Through her professional work, Sarah hopes to destigmatize the topic of mental illness in urban discourse and planning.
