Holder of a bachelor's degree in landscape architecture from the Université de Montréal, Andréanne is interested in the social issues of urban development, particularly through the lens of inclusivity and accessibility in public spaces. As part of her master's degree in planning, specializing in city, territory, and landscape, she explores the concept of positive solitude for women in urban environments and how public spaces can support this experience. Drawing on the principles of feminism, intersectionality, and the ethics of care, she seeks to rethink urban design by incorporating a care-centered approach that prioritizes women's autonomy and well-being.
