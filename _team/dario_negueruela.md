Dr. Dario Negueruela del Castillo has been serving as the Scientific Coordinator at the Center for Digital Visual Studies (Max Planck Institute - University of Zurich) since January 2020. From 2017 to 2019, he held the position of Head of Research at the ALICE lab at EPFL, where he earned his PhD in 2017 with a dissertation entitled "The City of Extended Emotions."

Dr. Negueruela del Castillo’s current research focuses on the implicit urban theory of Foundation Multimodal Deep Learning Models through his project “Clip and the City,” which examines how to leverage these models’ general learner capacities for urban analysis. He is also actively involved in the critical spatial curation of large collections using AI, demonstrated in his project “Newly Formed City” for the Helsinki Biennial.  His research spans architecture, urbanism, affect, and spatial and visual perception with an emphasis on imagination and spatial agency. Among others his current projects ‘On the Urbanity of Images’ and ‘Multimodality and Digital Apophenia’  explore the processes of machinic imagination, mimesis. and love and artificial desire.

In addition to his research, Dr. Negueruela del Castillo is the co-founder, along with Shin Koseki, of Data Think, a research and educational platform dedicated to critical and creative approaches to data and its methodologies. Data Think has successfully organized three summer and winter schools to date.

Dr. Negueruela del Castillo has substantial experience in curating and coordinating academic conferences and symposia, including the upcoming 'Digital Double 2024' in Rome, the '2021 Deep City International Symposium' in Lausanne, and the 'Scaffolds-Open Encounters' in 2018 in Brussels. His extensive publication record includes a recent paper assessing the influence of artificial intelligence on urban studies in 2023.
Among his current collaborations, Dr. Negueruela del Castillo organizes with Julio Paulos of ETH Future Cities Laboratory the symposium and edited volume "Digital Double- AI & Cities: Situating and Troubling AI Technologies for Architectural De/Reconstruction and Urban Simulation." Furthermore, he curates with Nuria Rodriguez Ortega from the University of Málaga a symposium and a research network focused on Generative Curation for the Fall of 2024. He is also working with Geoff Cox from the Center for the Study of the Networked Image on a project titled "Diagramming Diagramming,".

He is the editor of the volume "From Hype to Reality: Artificial Intelligence in the Study of Art and Culture," co-edited with Eva Cetinic and published by Hertziana Studies in Art History.
