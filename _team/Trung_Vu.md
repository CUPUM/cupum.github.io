I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering from the Hanoi University of Transport and Communications (Vietnam). I pursued graduate studies in France, earning a Master’s in Cities and Mobility from École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées (ENPC) in 2008, followed by a Specialized Master’s in "Freight Transport" in 2009, both with honors. I am currently a first-year Master’s student in Urban Planning, specializing in City, Territory, and Landscape at the University of Montreal.
