Roxane holds a master's degree in architecture from the École Nationale Supérieure d’Architecture de Marseille. After gaining professional experience in the field of social housing, she maintained a strong interest in the relationship between public and private spaces, with a particular focus on the notions of intimacy in urban environments. She is currently pursuing a master's degree in "City, Territory, Landscape" at the Faculty of Environment Design in Montreal, where she explores the forms of intimacy created by the design of spaces around water. Her research specifically examines the impact of major rivers in urban areas and the spatial and social dynamics they generate. She is primarily involved in projects related to the "Fluvialities” axis, developed by the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape.
