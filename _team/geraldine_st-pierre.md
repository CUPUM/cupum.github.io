Géraldine St-Pierre holds a Bachelor's degree in Arts with a major in Animation Cinema, obtained from Concordia University. Her studies led her to work in postproduction on animated television series. Interested in history, the environment, and understanding landscapes, she later pursued studies in geology at the University of Quebec in Montreal. A member of the Ordre des Géologues du Québec, she has worked in geological exploration and exploitation in Quebec, Ontario, and briefly in West Africa.
Inspired by various international social design projects and sensitive to physical and mental health issues related to access to green spaces and active mobility corridors, Géraldine shifted her focus to urban planning at the Faculty of Environmental Design at the University of Montreal. Attracted to projects related to the themes developed by the chair on "fluviality," her work specifically focuses on the territories of the Mississippi and Atchafalaya River basins, as well as new methodologies for studying territories, such as geoprospective.
