After her diploma in space design from École Boulle (Paris), Cassandre moved to Quebec in 2008, where she specialized in theater scenography thanks to a bachelor’s degree in “Design For Theatre” from Concordia University. Since graduating, she has worked as a set designer, researcher and teacher. Throughout her training in interior design, Cassandre’s work was largely influenced by Architecture. She specifically became interested in the relationship of the user with the space and how it can actually come to nourish her practice as a designer. She holds a master’s degree in theater from UQAM on this subject and now has a doctorate degree in Urban Studies INRS; where she developed an interest in the relationship between indigenous performances and the appropriation of space, as well as the co-creation of a methodology to rethink urban public spaces through dance.
