# Unesco Studio

A website for the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape

## Getting started

Setup ruby:

```sh
# to do
```

If you are on MacOS, you most-likely will need to configure the proper ruby verison else the vendor-provided verison will be used and it is too old to run this project's gems:

```sh
# to do
```

Install jekyll:

```sh
gem install jekyll bundler
```

Run the project locally:

```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```
