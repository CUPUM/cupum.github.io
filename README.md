## Media

To help yourself port content from the previous website (WordPress), you can find a folder of all uploaded content [**here**](https://udemontreal-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/emmanuel_beaudry_marchand_umontreal_ca/EjYYUu6IcZtNmYYq8zuDibEBtFP57etCu5Hp7SqkS81wbg?e=KxorDi).

## Getting started

Setup ruby:

```sh
# to do
```

If you are on MacOS, you most-likely will need to configure the proper ruby verison else the vendor-provided verison will be used and it is too old to run this project's gems:

```sh
# to do
```

Install jekyll:

```sh
gem install jekyll bundler
```

Run the project locally:

```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```
