We are pleased to share our latest study, “Public perceptions of Montréal's streets: Implications for inclusive public space making and management”, published in the Journal of Urban Management and co-authored by Rashid Mushkani, Hugo Bérard, Shin Koseki (Université de Montréal, Mila – Quebec AI Institute) and Toumadher Ammar (Université de Montréal).

How do ten people rate the same street? 
Our research shows the answers can be strikingly different, especially when people come from different walks of life.

Through interviews, image rankings, and group discussions, we explored how residents of Montréal perceive their streets. We found strong consensus on aesthetics and regenerative qualities, but far more divergence in inclusivity and practicality. Minority group participants, especially those with different abilities, often viewed streets in ways that challenged the majority perspective.

Importantly, small-group conversations helped narrow these perception gaps, offering a path toward more inclusive urban design. This research, supported by the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape, Université de Montréal, FRQ, and SSHRC-CRSH, sheds light on how participatory planning can bridge differences and create streets that work for everyone.
