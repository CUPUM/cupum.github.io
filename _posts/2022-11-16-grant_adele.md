Adèle Kremer, master’s student in Environmental Design at the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape, received a “master’s discovery” scholarship worth 5,000$ from the Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies of the University of Montreal.

“This -discovery scholarship- offered this year rewards three students registered full-time in one of the faculty’s research master’s programs. Like previous years, the selection was based on the research potential of the student and the condition of a full-time status”.
– Prof. Sylvain Paquette, director of the “City, Territory,Landscape” option of the master’s in Environmental Design.

After obtaining her degree in Geography at the University of Paris8, Adèle in intrigued about gender, identity spaces and the notion of inclusion. As she continues her journey within the master’s of “City, Territory, Landscape”, she intends to use the multidisciplinary nature of the program to explore the appropriation spaces of homeless women in urban contexts at night.
