Since last March, Emile Forest has joined the School of Urban Planning and Landscape Architecture as well as the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape and Environment at the University of Montreal (CUPEUM) as a visiting professor. Emile is co-founder of Nouveaux Voisins, an organization whose mission is to help regenerate relationships between humans and all living things by supporting citizens, actors, and public institutions in the fields of urban ecology, landscape architecture and horticulture.

As a visiting professor, he teaches in the environment and sustainable development program and leads the summer workshop at Jardins de Métis, offered to students of the Faculty of Planning at UdeM. This intensive workshop of research, creation and construction explores different themes that lie at the intersection of his practice at Nouveaux Voisins as well as the questions of the Chair in connection with the urbanization of large rivers and river ecoregions. Named “Paysages généreux, paysages faits main”, the 2023 edition of this summer workshop explores the experimental potentials of regenerative landscape architecture; with two gardens designed and built at the Jardins de Métis. This experimentation is structured around a series of questions which include: how to create plant communities that can enrich damaged ecologies and, at other times, be integrated into already diversified environments? What is the role of humans in the regeneration of such gardens, and what are the new experiences they can offer? How do we integrate  implementation strategies or mini-architectures for wildlife into these landscapes to meet the needs of other species and enrich the aesthetic experience of these gardens? Hence, beyond the physical gardens, the students will formulate a collaborative manifesto on the creative process and the potential of scaling up their gardens.

In addition to these teaching activities, Emile participates in the Fluvialities research project. He is leading a research-action project associated with a mandate to design and set up a riverside garden in Sainte-Flavie, in the Bas-Saint-Laurent region. This riverside garden makes it possible to test different approaches to ecological restoration in the context of coastal erosion, in addition to testing strategies for enhancing coastal landscapes.

The implication of Émile Forest to Atelier Métis is made possible thanks to the Sid Lee Architecture Fund.
