Leandry Jieutsa presented the results of his PhD research at the @Geoinno 2026 (8th Geography of Innovation Conference in Budapest). 

His research investigates how municipalities in Quebec use and regulate AI and it which conditions this can be done in a responsible manner. 

During his presentation, he shows that the benefits and risks of urban AI depend not only on municipal capacities, but also on the ecosystems in which cities are embedded.
