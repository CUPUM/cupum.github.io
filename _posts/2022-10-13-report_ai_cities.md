Divided into four parts, the guide first addresses the general issues of artificial intelligence today, and in particular in urbanized environments and cities; followed by a series of case studies and warnings relating to the deployment of AI systems in urban contexts. A particular innovation of this report consists in the establishment of a typology of risks related to AI in cities and beyond. The document ends with a series of strategic recommendations that can already be implemented by municipalities around the world, regardless of their size or level of technical development.

The guide is the result of collaborative work between several researchers and decision-makers associated with Mila and UN Habitat, as well as several young researchers from around the world. It falls under the “AI for Humanity” program of Mila, the Artificial Intelligence Research Center of Quebec, and the digital strategy of UN Habitat, the United Nations program for human settlements; whose headquarters is in Nairobi, Kenya. It also follows Prof. Shin Koseki’s involvement in research and governance of urban intelligent systems, initiated in 2018 by the “AI & Cities” cycle that he organizes each year as part of the international conference “Applied Machine Learning Days”.
