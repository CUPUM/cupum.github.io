Last fall, the 'Villes Régions Monde' (VRM) network launched a scholarship competition for graduate students finishing their thesis to encourage them in this final stage of their academic journey. Frédérique Roy, a master's student in urban planning and member of the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape, has been awarded a $3,000 scholarship.

VRM is an interuniversity network in urban studies dedicated to fostering collaboration, promoting research and disseminating research findings.
