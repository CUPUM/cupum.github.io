Discover Episode 6 “Urban Narratives: Crossing Perspectives” featuring Peter Soland, founder of Civiliti, a Montreal-based firm specializing in urban and landscape development projects. The episode is hosted by Leandry Jieutsa and Roxane Kasprzyk.

Peter wears many hats in the field of urban planning and stands out for his approach centered on the narrative of place. He explains how this perspective informs his design process and helps create projects that are deeply rooted in their context.

Together, they discuss the benefits of multidisciplinary approaches in urban planning, as well as the involvement of various stakeholders—both those already engaged and those who could be included in the development process.
