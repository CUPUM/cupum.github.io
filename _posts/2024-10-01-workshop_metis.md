This summer, the Jardins de Métis Summer Workshop “Jardins-outils for a World in Transition” experimented with regenerative landscape architecture approaches, involving 16 students who developed “tool gardens” to support the socioecological transition. These interventions aim to improve disrupted ecologies, rethink our aesthetics of the natural world, and encourage local climate action. The 2024 edition focused on strategies combining garden art and ecological restoration in partnership with Jardins de Métis and CMētis.
