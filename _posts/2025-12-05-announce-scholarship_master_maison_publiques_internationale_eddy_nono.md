Congrats to Eddy ! 

We are pleased to announce that Eddy Nono, student at the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape, has been awarded the Maison des aires publiques et internationales scholarship as part of his master’s program.

Eddy’s research focuses on citizen participation in the governance of AI applied to urban mobility, particularly in the Greater Montreal area.

This scholarship supports research students whose thesis looks at public policy or international issues, and how these topics affect the economy, population, or workplace relations. It also rewards projects that help guide decision-making and public discussions by providing useful knowledge for better public action.

Once again, congratulations to Eddy for this well-deserved recognition!
