The UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape presents this week the research of Andréanne Bernard, master’s student in Planning.

Holder of a bachelor’s degree in landscape architecture from the University of Montreal, Andréanne questions the social issues of urban development. She discovered an interest in inclusiveness, representation and accessibility in public spaces. Holder of a diploma in photography from the Cégep du Vieux Montréal, she wishes to understand and have contact with people through art, but also through her new field of expertise in planning.

In the continuation of her studies in the master’s of planning, option city, territory, landscape, she will explore the principles of feminism and the inclusive city. Andréanne will base her research on the solitary experience of women within the city, all based on intersectionality and equality in the design and accessibility of public spaces.
