Originally shown at the Albert and Tina Small Center for Collaborative Design in New Orleans, it is now on display at the pavilion of the Faculty of Environmental Design at the Université de Montréal.

Developed through the UNESCO Studio in New Orleans, this collection highlights seven neighborhoods of the city and offers a starting point for research-creation in planning and design. It invites visitors to explore how small-scale, low-tech interventions can enhance human and non-human living environments along the Mississippi River. Each proposal emerges from careful observation, dialogue with communities, and a commitment to thoughtful, collective transformation.

The UNESCO Studio is an intensive two-week international workshop organized by the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape at the Université de Montréal. The New Orleans edition was held in collaboration with the School of Architecture at Tulane University and Louisiana State University.

🗓️ January 15–29, 2026
