This year’s focus: New Orleans and its deep connection with water. The Mississippi’s shores reflect the river’s complex identity: a powerful force shaping the city’s economy and culture and a thriving ecosystem, yet also a looming threat with a history of devastation. While control measures often create a physical divide between communities and the water, they also present an opportunity to rethink how human livelihoods and the river can coexist in harmony.

Stay tuned for UNESCO Studio NOLA 2025!
