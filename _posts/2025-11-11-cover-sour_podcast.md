On October 22, 2025, the SOUR Podcast featured Rashid Mushkani (Lecturer, Université de Montréal; Researcher, Mila—Québec AI Institute) for a deep dive into co‑produced and public AI for cities. The conversation explores participatory datasets, pluralistic alignment, and governance grounded in data rights and data sovereignty—concrete ways to ensure AI reflects the values of the people it affects, rather than overwriting local knowledge.

Rashid discusses StreetReview, a community‑trained system for evaluating street quality, and AI Alignment for Inclusion (AIAI), a program that co‑designs alternatives with residents and civic partners. He advances a practical “Right to AI” and an augmented, co‑produced AI lifecycle where communities set the goals, metrics, and guardrails of the models shaping public space.
