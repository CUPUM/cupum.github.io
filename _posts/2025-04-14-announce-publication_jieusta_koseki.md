We’re excited to share the publication of a new paper by Leandry Jieutsa and Shin Koseki titled “Multilevel Collaborative Governance to Foster Responsible AI Deployment in Cities: Case Studies of eThekwini in South Africa and Thérèse-De Blainville in Quebec.”

Published in the inaugural edition of Oxford Intersections: AI in Society—a new interdisciplinary series by Oxford University Press—this paper investigates how small cities and Global South cities, can responsibly deploy artificial intelligence through multilevel collaborative governance frameworks. Based on a literature review and fieldwork including interviews with municipal officials and project teams, the article explores how cities navigate the technical, financial, and ethical challenges of AI deployment in resource-constrained environments.
