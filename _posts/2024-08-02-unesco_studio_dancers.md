Throwback to the closing ceremony of the UNESCO Studio 2024 Workshop, which took place last May at the Royal University of Fine Arts in Phnom Penh.

We were lucky enough to see a performance by អមោឃបាស - THE NEXT GENERATION. They are former dancers of Cambodia’s first gay Apsara dance company, Prumsodun Ok & NATYARASA, founded and directed by Prumsodun Ok.
Their mission is advocating gender equality and elavating the lives of LGBTQIA+ through art in Cambodia.

It was a great discovery of Khmer dance!
