Congratulations to Rashid Mushkani, doctoral student at the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape, for his two scholarships.    

Rashid received the Guy-Desbarats Excellence Scholarship from the University of Montreal, and the renown Doctoral Training Scholarship by the FRQSC (Fonds de recherche du Québec - Société et culture) valued at CAD 83,000 over the course of three years.

His research, done under the guidance of Prof.Shin Koseki, aims to develop "StreetReview," an AI-based application for measuring streetscape quality. StreetReview explores the inclusivity of public streets in Canadian cities, particularly focusing on how these areas serve diverse populations. It employs an AI-based approach to analyze streetscapes in Montreal, developed through research that collaboratively involves groups from different ages, backgrounds, genders, and religious beliefs.
