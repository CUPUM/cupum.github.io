Looking Back at the International Conference "Climate Action and Transitions: Perspectives from Québec and France"

Frédérique Roy, a master's student in urban planning and collaborator with the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape, presented her research during the "Cities and Planning" session.

Fred's research explores the lived experience and sociotechnical imaginary of environmental and climate justice activists regarding digital surveillance in Montreal. Her approach highlights environmental and climate justice movements as key and legitimate actors in the socio-ecological transition of cities.

The conference Action climatique et transitions : regards croisés Québec-France was organized by the Département de sociologie de l'Université Laval.
