After completing an internship at the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape last year and earning her bachelor's degree in architecture from the Royal Danish Academy in Copenhagen, Aleksandra Mostovaja is now continuing her academic journey at the Urban School of Sciences Po Paris, within the master's program Governing the Large Metropolis.

Focusing on the governance of large-scale metropolises, Aleksandra continues to explore the intersections between architecture, territory, and society.

We wish her all the best in this new chapter!
