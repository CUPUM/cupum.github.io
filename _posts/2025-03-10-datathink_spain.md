Itâ€™s a wrap for the Datathink workshop in Spain!

This thematic seminar for graduate studies in Environmental Design (PhD and MSc) invited participants to reflect on the operational modes, governance, impacts, and opportunities of AI for cities and urbanized territories. Conducted in collaboration with the Center for Visual Studies of the University of Zurich and the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia, the seminar consisted of five thematic workshops, including keynote presentations, practical exercises, and discussions on AI technologies.

Thank you to UdeM international for supporting this activity abroad.
