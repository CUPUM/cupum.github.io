Sarah Tannir, graduate from the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape, was awarded second prize for her poster on urban AI and mental health at Obvia’s colloquium “La santé dans tous ses états : Explorer les dynamiques numériques et leurs impacts”. Sarah’s poster stood out for its scientific quality, social contribution, and the accessibility of its content.

A collaboration between the research divisions of Obvia and the RRSPQ (Réseau de recherche en santé des populations du Québec), the colloquium was held on February 20 and 21, 2025, at the Hélène-Desmarais building of HEC Montréal. The event aimed to mobilize knowledge from various fields around the central themes of AI and health.
