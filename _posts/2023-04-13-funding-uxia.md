The UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape of the University of Montreal has received a new funding of $30,000 from the Vice-rectorate for Planning and Strategic Communication of the University of Montreal, to develop an Inclusive UX IA protocol, as part of the EDI 2023 call for projects of the Montreal Declaration for the responsible development of AI.

The Inclusive IA UX protocol will be developed from April 1st to September 30th, 2023 by a cross-industry team of social scientists and computer scientists; experts in digital ergonomics, indigenousness, AI and in Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI); and a group of 50 people drawn from the general population and recruited from organizations defending the rights of people from culturally dominated groups or dominated segments of the population. Together, these people are associated with the design and implementation of the IA UX Inclusive protocol through a series of meetings and workshops around the development of the “aggregator”, a tool for collecting and co-constructing data used to train machine learning algorithms.
