Last November marked the closing conference of the EVADIA+ and CAIAG projects, entitled “AI, Public Space, and Citizen Participation.”
 The event presented the results of both projects through two panel discussions: one on AI and citizen participation, and the other on AI and public spaces.

The EVADIA project is a research initiative aimed at creating an artificial intelligence–based tool to strengthen citizen participation in urban planning processes. The CAIAG project (Inclusive design of public spaces assisted by responsible, local, and equitable AI) sought to develop a body of theoretical, practical, and applied knowledge on the use of generative AI systems in the design of public spaces, in collaboration with citizens.

Many thanks to our panelists: Léandry Jieutsa, Lyne Nantel, Sylvie Paré, and Nathalie Boucher for the first panel, as well as Rashid Mushkani, Zakia Hammouni, Heather Braiden, and Peter Soland for the second. We also thank all of our partners — IVADO, Mila, and OBVIA — and all our collaborators.

Finally, if you are interested in the topic, the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape Podcast series features discussions with some of the project participants. The next episode will be released on Wednesday, January 21.
