Recap of the Fourth Meeting of the EVADIA+ Project Partners

Our latest meeting with project partners was an opportunity to review the progress of EVADIA+, a project aiming to develop inclusive AI to improve citizen participation in urban planning. We are currently in the design phase.

Discussions focused on the creation of an AI-assisted online survey for a housing project located at Victoria Précision site in Centre-Sud. Key issues included question formulation, citizen engagement, data privacy, and digital accessibility.

We also presented a collaborative AI platform with features like urban visualization, multilingual participation, and offline access.
The meeting reaffirmed our commitment to ethics, tech sustainability , and data transparency.

Next steps: launch of the platform, co-creation workshops, and analysis of community input.

A big thank you to our partners for their dedication and collaboration: Observatoire Québécois des Inégalités, société logique, écologique urbaine, rues principales, IVADO, Mila Québec, Civiliti Montréal, Vivre en Ville, Organisme Respire, Scikoop and Numana.
