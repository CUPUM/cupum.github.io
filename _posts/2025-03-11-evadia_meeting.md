EVADIA is a research project conducted at the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape that aims to use AI to respond to citizen needs in urban planning projects.

The third partner meeting which took place at Mila in February, focused on closing the framing phase of EVADIA+. During the meeting, the team from the UNESCO Chair and members from partner organizations shared their thoughts on the project and its challenges: from data representativity, inclusion to potential biases caused by AI.
The project is now moving into its next exciting phase: the development of an inclusive AI!
