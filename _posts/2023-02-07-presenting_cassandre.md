The UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape welcomes Cassandre Chatonnier, scenographer, researcher and teacher.

Cassandre moved to Quebec in 2008, where she specialized in theater scenography thanks to a bachelor’s degree in “Design For Theatre” from Concordia University. Throughout her training in interior design, Cassandre became interested in the relationship of the user with the space and how it can actually come to nourish her practice as a designer. She holds a master’s degree in theater from UQAM on this subject and now has a doctorate degree in Urban Studies INRS; where she developed an interest in the relationship between indigenous performances and the appropriation of space, as well as the co-creation of a methodology to rethink urban public spaces through dance.

Cassandre will work on the AI-EDI public space research project, carried out under the direction of Prof. Shin Koseki at the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape. The main objective of this project is to develop a participatory methodology to produce an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm capable of assessing levels of equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) from images of public spaces.
