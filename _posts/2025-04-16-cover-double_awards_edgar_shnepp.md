As part of its commitment to supporting emerging researchers, the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape is pleased to announce its contribution to the Association of Graduate Studies in Environmental Design through two student awards. Both honors were presented to Edgard Schnepp, a PhD candidate at the University of Montreal’s School of Environmental Design, in recognition of his research project. Schnepp was selected by two separate juries—one for each award—during the Association’s annual colloquium, 360 degrees, held in March.


Edgar’s research explores the lived realities of immigrants in the suburbs, whose voices are often overlooked in local policies despite their strong presence. He investigates how digital technologies—like remote work and online shopping—shape their daily lives, mobility, and integration into urban spaces. Through online surveys and in-depth interviews, his work seeks to better understand the connection between digital practices and place, with the goal of building more inclusive cities.


Through its support of the Association of Graduate Studies in Environmental Design, the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape affirms its role in nurturing the next generation of scientists and decision-makers.
