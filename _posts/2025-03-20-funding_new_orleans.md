The School of Urban Planning and Landscape Architecture of the University of Montréal will provide support for the upcoming edition of the UNESCO Studio, set to take place in New Orleans in May 2025. This contribution will facilitate the organization of the international initiative and help communicate its outcomes. Thanks to this funding, the UNESCO Studio will be able to present the results of its fieldwork on the Mississippi both in New Orleans and Montreal.

The UNESCO Studio New Orleans marks the fifteenth edition of this renowned program, which has been active since 2003. Formerly known as the “Workshop Atelier Terrain UNESCO” (WAT UNESCO), it remains the only university course officially labeled by UNESCO. Over the years, it has contributed to improving urban resilience and quality of life in cities such as São Paulo, Reggio Calabria, Shanghai, Kobe, Montreal, and Évry.

With a growing focus on climate adaptation in large river cities, the UNESCO Studio has previously worked on Hanoi (Red River) and Phnom Penh (Mekong River). In 2025, the project will turn its attention to the complex and evolving relationship between New Orleans and the Mississippi River, addressing critical challenges posed by climate change, flooding, and urban resilience.
