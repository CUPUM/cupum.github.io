On March 26th, we held our second workshop with our partners as part of the EVADIA+ project. These workshops aim to strengthen organizations' knowledge and capabilities in AI.
During this workshop, participants presented various case studies demonstrating the potential of AI in planning, including tools for generative ideation, urban accessibility audits, landscape design assistance, and more. Important issues were identified, such as potential biases in data, the risk of critical errors, and the need to maintain a balance between the use of AI and the preservation of human creativity.
Thank you to all our collaborators: Observatoire québécois des inégalités, Société Logique, Numana, Scikoop, Organisme Respire, Centre d’Écologie Urbaine, Rues principales, IVADO, Mila - Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute, civiliti, and Vivre en Ville.
