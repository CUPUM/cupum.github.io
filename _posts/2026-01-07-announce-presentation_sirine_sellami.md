Sirine Sellami is a PhD candidate at the Institut des Arts et Métiers of Sfax, Tunisia. She is joining the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape for a three-month internship.

Her research focuses on the reappropriation of the flâneur’s experience in Mediterranean coastal cities. Through a sensory, perception-based approach, she explores the relationship between the territory of the self and the urban territory, seeking to better understand how public space can once again become a medium for exploration, meaning, and attachment.

Her work resonates with the research conducted at the Chair and highlights key issues related to inclusion.

Welcome, Sirine!
