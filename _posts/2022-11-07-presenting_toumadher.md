The UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape presents this week the arrival of Toumadher Ammar.

Graduate in architecture from the National School of Architecture and Urban Planning in Tunis (2009) and doctor of architecture from the University of CARTHAGE and the University of GRENOBLE ALPES (2017), Toumadher was also an independent researcher at CRESSON between 2017 and 2020, as well as a teacher at ENAU from 2017 to 2022. Her work intersects the theories of the sensitive and of interbreeding. She wonders about the impact of migratory movements in the Mediterranean on the “ambiences” and on the sensitive future of urban spaces. It also looks at different methods of characterizing the urban, mainly those allocated to the approaches: sensitive, historical, and syntactic.

As part of her postdoctoral research at the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape, Toumadher will work on the ESPACE EDI project, which lies at the crossroads of artificial intelligence technology and urban and social sciences. The main objective of this project is to produce two artificial intelligence software to assess and increase the level of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion from images of public spaces.
