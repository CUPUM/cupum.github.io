The two-week WAT UNESCO in Hanoi was marked by a visit to the Canadian Embassy in Hanoi. On May 15th 2023, participating students from University of Montreal met with Mr. Shawn Steil, Ambassador of Canada to Vietnam, to discuss about the role of Canada in Vietnam and the importance of initiatives like the WAT UNESCO, organized by the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape of the University of Montreal. One of the objectives of this year’s workshop, as stated by Prof. Shin Koseki, director of the Chair, is to find tangible and creative solutions for the inclusive and sustainable development of Hanoi’s Red river. The collaboration between students, local and international researchers, urban planners, landscape architects, policy experts as well as communties from the local population and authorities, will result in a final master plan showing a new vision to the city’s development surrounding the Red river and its inhabitants.
