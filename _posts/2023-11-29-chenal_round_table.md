The UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape is organizing a roundtable conference on December 6th from 12:45 p.m. to 2:45 p.m. with Jérôme Chenal, director of the “Excellence en Afrique” Center, a research unit in regional and urban planning at the Federal Polytechnic School of Lausanne (EPFL); and Prof. Shin Koseki, Director of the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape.

The city, the pivot of our societal developments, is being profoundly transformed by the digital revolution. From artificial intelligence to 5G, these advances are redefining our urban spaces and their management. The conference is dedicated to this change.

Bringing together researchers, urban planners and technological experts, this event explores the impact of digital advances on our cities. The debates address the current and future implications of this digital era on planning and urban life. Through various experiences, this conference aims to understand ongoing urban transformations and imagine creative solutions for more intelligent, inclusive and sustainable cities.

Time: 12:45-2:45 p.m.
Location: Pavilion of the Faculty of Planning of the University of Montreal (2940 Chem. de la Côte-Sainte-Catherine, Montreal, QC), room 3073
