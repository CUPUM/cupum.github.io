An international collaboration has begun to address one of the most pressing challenges of the 21st century: how to safeguard the environment while acknowledging the need for safer and efficient digital innovation? To bring answers, three French-speaking universities joined forces thanks to the G3 strategic partnership: the University of Montréal, the University of Geneva and the Free University of Brussels.

Spearheaded by the professors Shin Koseki (UdeM), Nicolas Baya-Laffite (UNIGE) and Wouter Achten (ULB), the project “Governing the Digital and Ecological Transition: Innovation, Exnovation and Sustainability” was presented in a first seminar in Brussels, hosted by the Free University of Brussels’ Socio-environmental dynamics research group (SONYA). The presentations focused on energy planning of local communities, socio-ecological risks of extractive industries, responsible governance of AI for inclusive urban development amongst other pressing topics.
