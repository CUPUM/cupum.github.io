In Habitat International (Vol. 164, Oct 2025), Rashid Mushkani and Shin Koseki present Street Review, a participatory method that blends interviews, focus groups, and a structured image-rating exercise to assess 20 Montréal streets (60 vantage points) across four criteria: Accessibility, Inclusivity, Aesthetics, Practicality. 

With 12 diverse participants and both pre-occupancy (visitors/newcomers) and post-occupancy (long-term residents) perspectives, findings show no single street meets all intersectional needs; and that group deliberation helps calibrate scores while surfacing deeper conflicts tied to identity, memory, and everyday mobility. 

This study was conducted with the support of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) and the Fonds de recherche du Québec (FRQ).
