Frédérique Roy, a master’s student in urban planning, received a $40,000 scholarship to develop research on the impact of urban technologies on anonymity. Holder of a bachelor’s degree in software engineering from Polytechnique Montréal, Ms. Roy is leading this project under the direction of Shin Koseki.

The scholarship was awarded by the Fonds de recherche du Québec – Nature et Technologies (FRQNT) which aims to support excellence in research and contribute to “ensure the next generation of students working in the various fields of research in the natural sciences, mathematics and engineering.

Ms. Roy’s research is at the crossroads of the fields of engineering and social sciences. This master’s project is part of the IA EDI Public Space research project, carried out by the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape. Led by Shin Koseki and funded by the New Frontier Research Fund, this cross-sectoral project uses artificial intelligence (AI) to make public spaces more inclusive. The project falls within the activities of the UNESCO Chair in connection with AI in the fields of planning and design, aiming to promote intersectoral and interdisciplinary research.
