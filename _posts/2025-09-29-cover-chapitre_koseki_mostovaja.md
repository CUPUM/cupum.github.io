The UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape is proud to announce the publication of a new chapter by Aleksandra Mostovaja and Shin Koseki in the forthcoming volume *… but, who are we building for?*, published by Building Diversity and the Danish Architectural Press. This second book by Building Diversity brings together more than thirty international contributions that critically reflect on inclusivity, equity, and belonging in architecture and the built environment.

The chapter, Bias in AI Visualizations: Language and Users, explores how artificial intelligence interprets language when generating visualizations of public spaces. By examining the impact of linguistic variations on AI-generated images, the authors highlight both the potential and the risks of these tools in shaping more inclusive urban design. Their research contributes to the broader conversation about bias, representation, and ethics in the intersection of AI and architecture.

The book will be officially launched on September 30 in Copenhagen, marking an important moment for the global dialogue on diversity in architecture. … but, who are we building for? will be available for purchase at the launch event and online.
