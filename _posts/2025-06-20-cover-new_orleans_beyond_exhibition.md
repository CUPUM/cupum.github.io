Developed through immersive, sensory research and dialogue with residents, the proposals present small-scale, low-tech interventions aimed at renewing connections to the river and enhancing the quality of life for all who call its banks home.

üëâüèªThe exhibition featured the work of 23 graduate students in architecture, landscape architecture, urban planning, and design from Tulane University, Louisiana State University, McGill University, Universit√© Laval, and the Universit√© de Montr√©al.

A heartfelt thank you to the Albert and Tina Small Center for Collaborative Design for making this exhibition possible!
