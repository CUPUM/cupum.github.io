Last month, Leandry Jieutsa, a PhD student specializing in AI governance in cities at the UNESCO Chair of Urban Landscape, was invited to give a recorded lecture as part of the "Digital Urban Lecture" series organized by the Cityscience.lab Hamburg. During the lecture, "AI Governance: What Stake for Cities?", he delves into the crucial topic of AI governance and its implications for urban areas.

Leandry highlights the need for a closer examination of AI governance approaches by cities, focusing on how AI is reshaping urban governance. The lecture explores the impact of AI on the involved actors, the tools utilized, and the governance mechanisms in place.
