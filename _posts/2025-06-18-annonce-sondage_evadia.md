Participate in the future of your neighbourhood!

The UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape at the Université de Montréal is working on the EVADIA+ project, which aims to create an artificial intelligence (AI) tool capable of integrating citizens’ voices into urban planning decisions.

Our study area? The area around the Victoria-Précision site, in the Sainte-Marie neighbourhood. 

To ensure this tool reflects your needs, ideas, and priorities, we need you! Whether you live, work, or simply feel connected to the area, your opinion matters.
Take 5 minutes to complete our short survey.
You can respond online via this link: consultation.victoria-precision.com
