The UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape and L’ENSEMBLE receive noteworthy funding from the Ministry of Economy, Innovation and Énergie du Québec (MEIE).

The UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape of the University of Montreal, in collaboration with L’ENSEMBLE, a non-profit organization dedicated to architectural and urban innovation for the benefit of inclusive territorial planning, announce the acquisition of $288,000 worth of funding, for the social innovation project “Densification solidaire Brome-Missisquoi” granted by the Ministry of Economy, Innovation and Energy of Quebec.

Responding to the persistent challenges of the housing crisis and climate change plaguing Quebec, the laboratory will rely on the collective intelligence of researchers in architecture and urban planning, municipal partners and non-profit organizations to test new models of inclusive and sustainable real estate development in the heart of the Brome-Missisquoi MRC territory. For example, the laboratory will be experimenting with strategies for gentle densification and requalification of underexploited sectors, to help direct urban growth towards areas already equipped with infrastructure and public services, located in the heart of our villages and cities.

To explore solutions on the ground, research, co-creation and consultation activities will be carried in conjunction with stakeholders and citizens of the Brome-Missisquoi MRC, for a period of 18 months. “The municipalities of Quebec know that they must act differently to respond to the scale of the challenges, particularly in terms of climate action and access to housing. The experimental projects of this laboratory will contribute to the generating of knowledge and supporting the emergence of new real estate models that meet the needs of communities; which can also be scaled up,” explained Alexandre Landry, architect and founder of L’ TOGETHER.

“As a main research partner, the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape of the University of Montreal is delighted by the MEIE support as it demonstrates a commitment to solve urban sprawl; one of the main challenges of the future” declared Shin Koseki, assistant professor at the School of Urban Planning and Landscape Architecture of the University of Montreal.

It is important to remember that this project will benefit from the support of the Brome-Missisquoi MRC, the collaboration of the SiS organization -which actively works to support the emergence of solidarity based real estate projects in the region-; as well as the “Communauté de pratique sur le foncier collectif et social”. The latter founded in 2021, bringing together more than 60 members and organizations.

Quebec municipalities, small and large, who wish to host an experimental project with the aim to encourage the emergence of innovative community housing models in their territories, are invited to contact L’ENSEMBLE team.
