The Evadia+ team of the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape had the pleasure of leading the AI Freskworkshop, proposed by Frédérique Roy and Hugo Berard during a collaborative session.

This participatory tool allowed the project’s contributors to reflect together on the impacts and evolutions of AI in the field of urban planning, through a playful and engaging format.

Developed by Frédérique Roy, Hugo Berard, and Émile Pronovost, the AI Fresk is a stimulating tool that encourages us to question the use of AI around us, by connecting cards that represent facts, issues, and perspectives.

Stay tuned: in the coming months, you will learn more about this Fresk and the Evadia+ project, with new presentations, insightful discussions… and an entirely new format for the Chair!
Coming soon…
