The UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape presents this week the arrival of its new member, Amal Gherbi-Rahal.

Amel holds a doctoral in urban studies from the National Institute for Scientific Research (INRS-UCS). She also holds a master’s degree in communication from UQAM. Her work focuses, among other things, on urban hospitality and the inclusion of migrants, her multidisciplinary profile has led her to experiment with various research methodologies and to intervene with several practice settings (university, municipal, civil society ).
Amel is currently contributing to the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape as a postdoctoral fellow in charge of co-developing the “IA/EDI public space” project. A project that aims to increase equity, diversity and inclusion in public spaces by bringing together urban science and artificial intelligence, as well as involving the participation of several sectors and stakeholders.
