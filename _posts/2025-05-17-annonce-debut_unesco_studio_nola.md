We’re excited to join the 15th edition of the UNESCO Studio, taking place in New Orleans (USA) from May 19 to 31!

This year, the workshop focuses on the connection between New Orleans and water — especially the historical, cultural, and geographic ties to the Mississippi River. It’s organized by the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape, in partnership with Tulane University and Louisiana State University.
Students from Université de Montréal, McGill University, Université Laval, Tulane University, and Louisiana State University will be working together.

During the workshop, participants will visit different sites along the river, meet local communities, city officials, and civil organizations. Using sensory data, students will design ideas to improve the riverfront in a way that supports a more inclusive and sustainable city. All projects will be presented in a final exhibition.
