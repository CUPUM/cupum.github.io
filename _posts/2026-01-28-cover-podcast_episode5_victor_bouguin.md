For this Episode 5, “Living Winter: Smart and Inclusive Spaces,” Leandry and Roxane welcome Victor Bouguin, who works at Vivre en Ville and is an expert in winter urban planning.

As we are right in the heart of the cold season, with snow shaping our landscapes and everything that comes with winter, this episode is the perfect opportunity to reflect on what we are currently experiencing and to think about how we can improve the way we live through this season.
Together, Leandry, Roxane, and Victor discuss the challenges of urban planning in making cities more inclusive, even in winter, while also exploring whether artificial intelligence can—or could—play a role in this reflection.

We’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences!
