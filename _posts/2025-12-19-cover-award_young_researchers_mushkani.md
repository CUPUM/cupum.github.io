Rashid Mushkani is the award recipient of the 3rd edition of the Faculty “Jeunes chercheurs, jeunes chercheuses : votre voix dans l'espace public.” competition. This distinction includes a $10,000 grant to support the dissemination of his research to the general public and policymakers over the coming year.

Rashid's research focuses on developing "public AI" for cities and cultural institutions, emphasizing participatory datasets, pluralistic alignment, and governance centered on data rights and sovereignty. He leads Street Review, a community-based platform for assessing street quality, and AI Alignment for Inclusion, which collaboratively designs AI solutions with residents and civic groups. His work promotes the Right to AI, advocating for an inclusive AI lifecycle where communities actively define the objectives, metrics, and protections shaping AI applications in public spaces.
