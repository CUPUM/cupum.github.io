New member of the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape!

Majdi Hunter-Batal, a master’s student in urban planning, is interested in tactical urbanism as a tool for redeveloping urban riverbanks. As part of his research, he explores how rapid, temporary, and low-cost interventions can sustainably transform our cities' waterfront spaces.

Supervised by Prof. Shin Koseki, he studies how tactical urbanism, based on citizen participation, fosters innovative “tactics” and moves away from traditional approaches to urban development.

His project is part of the “Rivers in Common” initiative, led by the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape. In a context where municipalities often face limited resources, his research proposes an alternative approach. His study will focus on both the Nile in Egypt and the St. Lawrence in Quebec.
