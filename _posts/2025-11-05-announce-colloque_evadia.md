On November 26, the closing conference of the EVADIA+ and CAIAG projects will take place, under the theme: “AI, Public Space and Citizen Participation.”

Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers increasing potential to strengthen citizen participation in urban planning processes. It is increasingly used to facilitate the collection, analysis, and synthesis of citizen contributions, whether for idea generation or the co-construction of development scenarios.
Among the many projects carried out by the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape over the 2024–2025 period is the CAIAG Project (Conception inclusive de l’espace public assistée par l’IA responsable, locale et équitable). Its objective was to develop a set of theoretical, applied, and practical knowledge on the use of generative AI systems in the design of public spaces in collaboration with citizens.
