This exhibition is the result of a two-week workshop conducted in Phnom Penh from May 13 to 24, 2024. Originally presented at the Royal University of Fine Arts in Cambodia, it is now being recreated at the University of Montreal.

Entitled “Phnom Penh Against the Current,” the exhibition explores the harmonious relationship between human beings, the city's non-human world, and the powerful waters of its rich watershed. This unique event highlights ten “sangkats” (neighborhoods) through a collection of objects and projects reflecting the intertwined perspectives and aspirations of young people from here and abroad.
