The UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape presents this week the research of Roxane Kasprzyk, master’s student in Planning.

During her training in architecture at the Ecole Nationale Supérieure in Marseille, Roxane was always interested in the public/private relationship of inhabited spaces. After some professional experience in the field of the public sector and collective housing, she decided to question herself on the urban social issues in public spaces and more particularly the spaces composed with the presence of water.
As she continues her master’s degree in city, territory and landscape planning, she will have to question the place and role of intimacy and understand the new sociabilities within a public sector.
