Eddy Damaris, as a student member of OBVIA, presented the core issue of his research during the "Fresque de la rel√®ve" session.

Eddy seeks to understand how artificial intelligence is transforming urban mobility management in Montreal. He aims to explore the extent to which citizen participation can influence public policies and the governance of these technological systems.

The Obvia Scientific Day highlights the diversity of research projects and promotes interdisciplinary reflection. It also offers networking opportunities to strengthen future collaborations within the community.
