The UNESCO Studio New Orleans aims to enhance the quality of living environments along the Mississippi River through design and planning practices grounded in sensory data collection.

Week 1 focuses on developing a sensibility to urban space through a series of hands-on workshops. In each session, participants engage with a specific research method and produce material representations of a designated area.
