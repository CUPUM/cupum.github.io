Shin Koseki receives funding for an international and intersectorial collaboration on the digital and ecological transition. With the support of the G3 program, the holder of the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape will develop a series of international workshops and summer schools on this pressing topic.

The project is conducted in collaboration with Wouter Archten and Nicolas Baya-Laffite, professors at the University of Bruxelles and the University of Geneva, respectively. The collaboration will focus on the concept of “twin transition”, a policy-making concept under development to address ecological and digital transformations conjointly.

The collaboration will extend from 2024 to 2027 and should help develop new tools to address sustainability and digitization in cities, while providing training for students in design, planning, social science, and engineering.
