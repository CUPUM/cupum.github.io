On Tuesday October 10th, the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape celebrated the unveiling of the Nplex web platform, an initiative of the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape at the University of Montreal.

Nplex is a platform developed by Emmanuel Beaudry-Marchand, research professional at the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape, which serves to promote local excellence in design and promote the use of services coming from design professionals in residential construction projects; among citizens and citizens of Montreal. Nplex offers the possibility to showcase exemplary projects in Montreal that will attract the interest of both professional and municipal stakeholders as well as individuals who wish to get involved in the construction or renovation of their homes.

The 5 to 7 event took place in the entrance hall of the Faculty of Planning of the University of Montreal during which the platform was presented to the guests. This meeting was an opportunity to interact with other members of the Nplex community and the project development team, and collaborators from the city of Montreal.

The UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape would like to thank Ville de Montréal for financially supporting* the Nplex project. The platform is also made possible thanks to the generous support of the Sid Lee Architecture Fund, as well as the Ministère de la Culture et des Communications du Québec.

*Project financed under the Agreement on the Cultural Development of Montreal concluded between the City of Montreal and the government of Quebec and by the Sid Lee Architecture Fund.
