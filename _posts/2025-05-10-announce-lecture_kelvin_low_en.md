Online Lecture – Sensory Approaches to Cities
Ahead of the upcoming UNESCO Studio in New Orleans (May 19–30), we are pleased to welcome Kelvin E.Y. Low, Associate Professor and Head of the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at the National University of Singapore, for an online lecture on May 13.

"Intersecting Urban Histories, Heritage-Making and Sensory Approaches" This lecture will explore sensory dimensions in urban studies, at the crossroads of heritage, social memory, and lived experience.

A specialist in sensory studies, migration, memory, and food culture, Kelvin E.Y. Low is the author or editor of several works, including his latest book Sensory Anthropology: Culture and Experience in Asia (Cambridge University Press, 2023).
