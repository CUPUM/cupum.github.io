Last November, Eddy Nono took part in the Scientific Exchange Day in Chicoutimi, on the theme: "Territorial Governance and Social, Economic, Political, and Environmental Changes: Challenges, Actors, and Solutions", an event sponsored by the Laboratory of Alternative Governance (LAGORA).

Students from different universities came together to share their work and talk about topics like public policy, social and environmental resilience, citizen participation, managing conflicts over land use, and other issues related to territorial governance.

Under the guidance of Prof. Shin Koseki, Eddy is studying how citizens can participate in AI and mobility governance in the Montreal area.
