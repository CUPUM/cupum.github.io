The Lab component of L'ENSEMBLE (the first Quebec laboratory focused on combining densification and housing) presented its progress to Sutton’s City Council, marking a key milestone in this densification project. Over the past 12 months, the team has been actively working in the Brome-Missisquoi RCM to identify sites in five municipalities and develop concrete projects in Sutton. The next step will be a public exhibition at École d'art de Sutton to mobilize the community around non-profit housing solutions. L'ensemble plans to roll out this initiative at both the RCM and provincial levels.
