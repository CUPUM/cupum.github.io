Hosted by Leandry Jieutsa and Roxane Kasprzyk, this episode titled “Rethinking the City Through Universal Design” features Pierre-Étienne Gendron-Landry, Head of Société Logique, as a guest.

Together, they discuss the integration of universal design in planning, its role in urban projects, and its essential contribution to an inclusive approach, considered from the very early stages of the design process.

Today, we’re talking about design but not just any design: design that allows everyone to feel included in our living environments.
