The UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape is pleased to share that Professor Shin Koseki was recently invited to take part in the academic examination of the architecture program at Universit√© Laval. Programs under review were the research master of architecture, the master of urban design and the PhD in architecture. His participation in this international delegation reflects the recognition of his expertise in urban design and the growing contribution of the Chair to conversations on architectural education.

The examination took place over two days and included a series of meetings with the university‚Äôs rectorate, the Faculty of Planning, Architecture, Art and Design, and members of the School of Architecture, including both faculty and students. These discussions offered an opportunity to reflect collectively on the program‚Äôs direction and future development.

The Chair values this kind of academic engagement, which strengthens ties between institutions and supports shared efforts to improve teaching and research in architecture and urbanism. We thank @ulaval for this invitation and congratulate Professor Koseki for his contribution.üëèüèΩ
