On May 9th and 10th, the EVADIA+ project team participated in the participatory urban planning workshop organized in the Centre-Sud region around the Victoria Pr√©cision site.

We tested AI tools applied to citizen participation and discussed with residents their needs and aspirations. This enriching experience is fueling our project to develop an AI tool to better capture community expectations in development projects.

A big thankyou to the organizers and participants for their commitment!
