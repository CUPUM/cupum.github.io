The UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape is launching its podcast series!

We are pleased to announce the release of the introductory episode, “Episode 0 – Présentation de la nouvelle série de podcasts de la Chaire UNESCO en paysage urbain,” which launches our new podcast series dedicated to urban planning and discussions surrounding artificial intelligence.

Hosted by Leandry Jieutsa, PhD candidate and collaborator at the Chair, and Roxane Kasprzyk, master’s research student and collaborator, this first season builds on the EVADIA+ project.

This research project aims to develop an AI-based tool to enhance citizen participation in urban planning processes and concluded with the symposium “AI, Public Space, and Citizen Participation.” Throughout the episodes, you will hear conversations with various professionals who took part in the project’s workshops.

This initiative reflects the commitment of the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape to sharing knowledge and making its work accessible to a broader audience.

A new episode will be released every Wednesday on YouTube and Spotify. Your feedback will be invaluable in helping this project grow and shape future seasons!

A warm thank you to all participants and to the Université de Montréal for providing access to the recording studio.

Enjoy listening!
