Frédérique Roy, master’s student at the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape, has been selected to receive financial support from LOJIQ (Les Offices Jeunesse Internationaux du Québec) to participate in the 13th edition of RightsCon! RightsCon is the largest international conference focused on the intersection of human rights and new technologies, which will take place this year in Taipei, Taiwan, from February 24 to 27, 2025.

Thousands of international participants (including digital professionals, human rights advocates, journalists, artists, researchers, and entrepreneurs) are expected to attend this conference with the aim of promoting a responsible use of technology in the digital age.
