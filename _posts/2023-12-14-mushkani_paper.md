Rashid Mushkani, doctoral student at the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape, presented his research at the “Benchmarking Spatial Justice in Policymaking, Planning and Design” Symposium. 

The 3-day hybrid event was organized by the Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) Centre for the Just City, Netherlands. The Symposium which internationally grouped researchers, scholars, policymakers, and practitioners from various disciplines, aimed to “foster discussions and exchange of knowledge regarding the measurement and evaluation of spatial justice in policymaking, planning and urban design”.

Rashid’s article, “Benchmarking Inclusion in Public Space: An Image-based Assessment Method,” examines inclusion through a place-based lens. It advocates for a shift towards a group-based approach, incorporating street-level imagery methods. Digital platforms such as Google Street View, Mapillary, and similar services offer an extensive array of urban space imagery, presenting new opportunities in the study of inclusion. Utilizing these resources allows for detailed evaluations on both group and individual bases across diverse locales and streetscapes, providing insights that may not be as readily accessible through traditional methods.

This research falls under the ongoing work of the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape in studying inclusion in public spaces.
