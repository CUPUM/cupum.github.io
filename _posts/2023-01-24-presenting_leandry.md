The UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape welcomes Leandry Jieutsa, doctoral student in digital urban governance who will be working under the supervision of Shin Koseki. Leandry will contribute to several research projects, including an intersectoral study on the impact of 5G antennas on the urban landscape, developed in collaboration with Tarik Djefari (INRS) and Guillaume Sasseville (UQÀM). Leandry will also take over the animation and coordination of the Environment, Smart City, Territory and Mobility axis at OBVIA – International Observatory of the Societal Impacts of Artificial Intelligence.

Leandry is an urban planner who is passionate about issues of resilient, sustainable and smart cities. A specialist in urban policies and digital urban governance too, he worked on these issues in particular within UN-HABITAT for a few years. He is also the founder of the Africa Innovation Network, a research-action laboratory that brings together experts in diverse and varied fields to propose sustainable and innovative solutions to the complex problems related to the urbanization of the African continent.

The topics of urban digital governance, and particularly artificial intelligence, are at the heart of the discussion at the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape; with several members recently contributing to the drafting of “AI & Cities: Risks, Applications and Governance”. This white paper, published by UN Habitat in collaboration with MILA, sets out a series of recommendations on the use and deployment of AI in urban settings.
