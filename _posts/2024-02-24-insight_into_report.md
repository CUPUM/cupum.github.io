The UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape publishes a new report based on an ongoing series of seminars about digital governance in cities.

*Insight Into* is a series of multidisciplinary discussions, organized by the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape, on the challenges of emerging technologies in cities. Through the experiences and perspectives of researchers, professionals and citizens from different fields, this initiative delves into the world of emerging urban technologies, in a transversal and holistic manner.

The report below summarizes the ideas shared by our webinar speakers around the deployment of such technologies in cities. Through their varied perspectives and stances, it highlights new ideas and raises awareness on the potential impact of urban technologies, as a way to build more citizen-centeric cities.
