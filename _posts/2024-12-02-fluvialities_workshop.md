On November 26th, the School of Public Health at the Université de Montréal, with the collaboration of Espace pour la vie, organized a series of co-creation workshops under UdeM's initiative "Une seule santé urbaine". Shin Koseki, director of the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape, led one of the workshops entitled "The resilience of ecosystems and riverine communities".

The workshop tackled the future of the Saint Lawrence river, one of the largest ecosystem in North America, and aimed to define a multidisciplinary vision for its shores. It was comprised of three interactive activities ranging from annotated maps, assisted illustrations, as well as group discussions. Participants were encouraged to imagine a desirable future for the river, its ecosystems, infrastructures, and inhabited areas.

The workshop also brought together several organizations, including the Ville de Montréal (section Berges), Fondation Rivières, Age of Union, and La Graine te le Semoir.
