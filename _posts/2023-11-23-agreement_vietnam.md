The collaboration between the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape and the Hanoi Architectural University has led to the signing of an agreement between the prestigious university in Vietnam and the Faculty of Environmental design of the University of Montreal.

Signed on November 7th by Mr. Le, rector of the Hanoi Architectural University and Ms. Cucuzzella, dean of the Faculty of Environmental design from the University of Montreal, the five-year agreement opens the door to new opportunities and collaboration between the two institutions, particularly for researchers and students in architecture courses, landscape architecture, planning and interior design.

This agreement happened following the WAT UNESCO’s 13 edition, which took place on May 2023 in Hanoi. Initiated by the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape, the WAT offers an international research-creation and research-action activity in which researchers, teachers and students from the Hanoi Architectural University develop new proposals for the city as part of Hanoi’s new designation as an UNESCO Creative City.

The Hanoi Architectural University is the largest and most renowned university in Vietnam in the field of planning. It welcomes nearly 17,000 students in the disciplines of arts, design and computer science. Recognized for its dynamism and prestige, it forms the country’s architectural and artistic elite. It has several international partnered institutions and offers numerous programs in French and English, including diplomas issued by the French Ministry of Culture.
