Dr. Shin Koseki, Professor at the Université de Montréal and holder of the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape, publishes a new article in the latest issue of Urbanité, the magazine of the Ordre des urbanistes du Québec. Known for his work on the governance of artificial intelligence (AI) in cities, Dr. Koseki reflects on how urban planners can help ensure that AI technologies serve democratic, inclusive, and ecological goals rather than amplify social or environmental risks.

The special issue of Urbanité focuses on artificial intelligence, an area in which Quebec stands out internationally for both its technological expertise and its commitment to responsible governance. Through diverse contributions, the magazine explores how AI is transforming the way cities are designed, managed, and experienced.

In his article (pp. 13–15), Dr. Koseki argues that “the ramifications of artificial intelligence in society do not spare cities, which have become one of its main fields of experimentation. To address the many challenges posed by this technology, municipalities have both the opportunity — and the responsibility — to contribute actively to the democratic, inclusive, and equitable development of algorithms.”
