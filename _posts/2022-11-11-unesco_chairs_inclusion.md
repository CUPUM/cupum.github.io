UNESCO welcomed its research chairs from around the world to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the UNITWIN program which sponsors them. The event, which took place on November 3rd and 4th at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris, was an opportunity for the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape to reconnect with its international counterparts. The program included: meetings with the UNESCO Chairs of Canada and the Canadian Commission for UNESCO, and a meeting of the UNESCO Chairs of Quebec in company with the national delegation and workshops on the protection of culture, and the development of new international initiatives.

With the support of the International Coalition for Inclusive and Sustainable Cities, the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape organized its second annual meeting of UNESCO Chairs on social inclusion in the city. Together, they expressed the common wish to create an international think tank on this major 21st century theme, and to hold an expanded meeting of UNESCO chairs for inclusive and sustainable cities in 2023.

This initiative is led by Shin Koseki, Director of the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape, and Assistant Professor at the School of Urban Planning and Landscape Architecture at the University of Montreal, in collaboration with Giovanna Marconi, UNESCO Chair in Social and Spatial Inclusion of Migrants at the University Institute of Architecture in Venice, and Robert J. Chaskin, UNESCO Chair in Inclusive Urbanism at the University of Chicago.
