The 14th edition of the UNESCO studio will take place in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, from May 13 to 24, 2024. 

This year's UNESCO studio aims to initiate a thoughtful reflection on how design can elevate the quality of life, while minimizing the human impact on the territory along riverine landscapes. The workshop will focus on the Mekong river, which plays a significant role in the economy, industry, culture, and biodiversity of Phnom Penh. 

Participating students will delve into the intricacies of the Mekong, to develop sensitive and sustainable design strategies and interventions. The outcome of the research and design workshops will be curated into an exhibition. 

The workshop is organized by the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape in collaboration with the UNESCO Office in Phnom Penh, UNHabitat, the Royal University of Fine Arts, the Royal University of Law and Economics, the Royal University of Phnom Penh, Norton University and King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi.
