A new working report on digital governance in cities derived from the Chair’s series of online seminar *Insights Into*.

Those multidisciplinary discussions address  the challenges of emerging technologies in cities. Through the experiences and perspectives of researchers, professionals and citizens from different fields, this initiative delves into the world of emerging urban technologies, in a transversal and holistic manner.

The report summarizes the ideas shared by our webinar speakers around the deployment of such technologies in cities. Through their varied perspectives and stances, it highlights new ideas and raises awareness on the potential impact of urban technologies, as a way to build more citizen-centeric cities.
