Shin Koseki, UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape at the Université de Montréal and affiliate member of Mila – Quebec’s AI Institute – took part in the XVIII UNESCO Creative Cities Network (UCCN) Conference, held in Paris on June 23–24, 2025. The annual gathering brought together cities and experts from around the world to exchange ideas on culture, creativity, and urban sustainability.

In his address to the attendees, Koseki shared recent research and experimentation on the use of artificial intelligence to improve the quality and inclusiveness of public spaces. He presented three key projects developed in Montreal: Évaline, which map urban environments from the perspectives of marginalized communities; Évadia+, a tool for inclusive and transparent public consultations; and AIAI, an algorithm designed to correct biases in generative image models used in urban planning and design.

👉🏻Koseki’s presentation reflected the values promoted by the UNESCO Creative Cities Network, which supports cities in placing creativity at the heart of sustainable development. His work emphasized cross-sector collaboration, responsible AI development, and the meaningful participation of underrepresented groups in shaping the future of urban life.
