The UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape at the Universit√© de Montr√©al is proud to announce a new collaboration with photographer-researcher Alexandre Campeau-Vall√©e for a groundbreaking exhibition at the @niagarafallsmuseums Set to open in summer 2026, the exhibition will explore the interwoven political and ecological tensions of the Niagara Falls region through an immersive, research-creation approach. The project will transform the museum space into a working landscape architecture studio, inviting visitors into an evolving dialogue between past and present.

Drawing inspiration from both historical garden traditions and contemporary design practices, the exhibition will juxtapose selected artefacts from the museum‚Äôs extensive collection with new site-specific interventions. Campeau-Vall√©e‚Äôs concept blurs the boundaries between exhibition and atelier, engaging visitors‚Äîincluding children‚Äîin a co-creative process that evolves over time. The exhibition aims to provoke reflection on how landscapes are governed, preserved, and experienced in borderland contexts.

üëâüèΩThis collaboration extends the UNESCO Chair‚Äôs mission to foster interdisciplinary, critical, and inclusive perspectives on landscape futures. In addition to public programming and participatory installations, the partnership will include contributions from students, local and international experts, and Indigenous advisors. A public opening and a dedicated panel event are planned, with regular updates to be shared across institutional channels. The Chair and Campeau-Vall√©e look forward to welcoming the public to this unique, living exhibition.
