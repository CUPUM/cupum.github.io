Shin Koseki delivered a keynote presentation on the governance and responsible development of AI in cities during a training day for urban planning organizations based in Québec. Organized by “Vivre en Ville et Rues Principales”, the training focused on the risks and opportunities associated with this new technology as it begins to integrate into practices of planning and design of public spaces.

This presentation is part of an ongoing effort by the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape in raising awareness about the deployment of AI in urban spaces and its use by cities and municipalities. The UNESCO Chair team stands out on a global scale for their work on urban AI governance as well as their methods in the development of responsible AI algorithms.
