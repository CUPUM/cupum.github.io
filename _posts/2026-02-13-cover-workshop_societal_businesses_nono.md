Last January, Eddy Nono led a workshop as part of the 2026 Launch Bootcamp, organized by the Millénium Québecor – Université de Montréal. This event aimed to invite participants to reflect on their personal motivations for entrepreneurship, notably through activities focused on developing their entrepreneurial skills and taking ownership of their problem space.

Eddy facilitated a workshop entitled Ideathon: Cities in Transition, designed to highlight the ethical challenges related to AI and data management in a context where cities are becoming increasingly smart.
