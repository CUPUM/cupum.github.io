Rashid Mushkani, PhD student at the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape, won the third prize for his presentation "Locked Out by Design" during the grand finale of Mila's Speed Science contest on June 5, 2025.

On June 5, Mila held the finals of the second edition of Speed Science, its science communication competition.
AI researchers took the stage to explain their work in just 3 minutes to a jury and a public audience.
After weeks of coaching, they learned how to share their research in a clear and simple way.
A great way to make AI more accessible to everyone!

Rashid Mushkani presented "Locked Out by Design" a talk about how urban design and public infrastructure often exclude people with disabilities and seniors.
He shared how he collaborated with community groups to evaluate street accessibility using AI and how he’s now using generative tools to reimagine inclusive public spaces through co-design.
