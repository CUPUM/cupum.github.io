At the end of October, Eddy Nono presented a poster titled “AI for Urban Mobility: The Role of Citizen Participation” at the IVADO Digital Futures event.

This event provides students with the opportunity to present their research work while discovering that of the broader IVADO student and postdoctoral community.

Eddy’s poster highlights his research on citizen participation in the governance of AI applied to urban mobility, with a focus on the Montreal metropolitan region.
