Last fall, the ‘Villes Régions Monde’ (VRM) network launched a writing competition to offer three grants to masters and doctoral students affiliated with the network. Sarah Tannir, graduate from the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape, was awarded the grant of $3,000 for the completion of her master’s thesis entitled “Breaking Stigma: The Impact of Urban AI on Citizens’ Mental Health.”

VRM is an interuniversity network in urban studies dedicated to fostering collaboration, promoting research and disseminating research findings.
