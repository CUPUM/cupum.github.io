Rashid Mushkani, PhD student at the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape presented his paper at NeurIPS, the Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, which took place in Vancouver last december. His paper “MID-Space: Aligning Diverse Communities’ Needs to Inclusive Public Spaces”, introduced the MID-Space dataset, which aims to align AI-generated urban visualizations with diverse community preferences.

The dataset was developed in collaboration with Mila, the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape, as well as 12 community organizations, and 4 architecture and planning firms.
