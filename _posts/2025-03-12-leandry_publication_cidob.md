Leandry Jieutsa, doctoral student at the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape, recently published an article on “Fairness and non-discrimination in urban AI” for CIDOB, the research centre in international relations based in Barcelona.

The chapter divided into three sections, presents policy recommendations for integrating aspects of fairness and non-discrimination into the deployment of AI by cities. According to Leandry, “cities need to be agile, relying on participation, local approaches, sociotechnical innovation, and collaboration.”
