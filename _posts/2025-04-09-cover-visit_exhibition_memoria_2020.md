In preparation for the UNESCO Studio NOLA, we had the privilege of visiting the exhibition Memoria 2020 "Lorsque les souvenirs ne suffisent plus": an installation about the Mardi Gras Indians community of New Orleans, and to discuss with its artist, Diva Muanza.

The exhibition is on view at the Université de Montréal Gallery, as part of “Triennale recherche-création de l’Université de Montréal”, running until June 14.
