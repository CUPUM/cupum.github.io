Last week was Emmanuel's final week at the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape. Emmanuel had been a research professional at the UNESCO Chair for four years. He developed the Nplex web platform, which aims to showcase exemplary residential and construction projects in Montreal. He was also the go-to person for all IT and logistical issues. He helped us a lot!

We wish him all the best for the future and for his new adventures!
