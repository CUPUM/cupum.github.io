Adèle Kremer, a UNESCO Chair Alumni graduate student (2022–2025), has joined the prestigious ETH joint Master of Advanced Studies in Urban and Territorial Design (MAS UTD) at ETH/EPFL.. The one-year program, led and conceived by Paola Viganò and Milica Topalovic, “engages with notions of transformation, reuse, circularity, regeneration, reparation, and transition of habitats and ecologies to deploy the urban and territorial project as a means to explore common epistemic horizons and new biopolitical paradigms, and as a crucial field of knowledge production across scales.“

The MAS UTD places strong emphasis on research through design, on-site exploration, and the creation of new concepts, images, figures, and symbols related to space and its representation.

Adèle’s new journey follows the completion of her master's thesis in environmental design on the role of Montreal homeless women in placemaking, which was supervised by Shin Koseki.
