### We are happy to provide science-led responses and solutions that meet your urban aspirations.

We live in troublesome times, and many organisations, big and small, face challenges like never before. Climate change, ecosystemic collapse, political feud, social inequalities and disruptive technologies require innovative solutions.

We provide assistance in various formats in accordance with the service and contract policies of the University of Montréal.

#### Research contracts

We carry out research projects in collaboration with public institutions, municipalities, NGOs, and private companies. These contracts allow partners to access our scientific expertise, cutting-edge methodologies, and international networks to address complex urban challenges.

A research contract is an agreement between partners in which one or more parties provide financial support to researchers of the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape (from one or several institutions) to conduct research in a specific field under defined conditions. The outcomes of the project cannot be predicted with certainty, as there is a level of scientific uncertainty and significant scope for original scientific or technical contribution.

#### Research services

We offer access to specialized data analysis, urban simulations, participatory design tools, and evaluation frameworks. Our team can support you in producing evidence-based insights that strengthen decision-making and long-term planning.

A service contract is an agreement for the provision of specific deliverables—such as analysis results, tests, or measurements—based on existing expertise. The contract must clearly define the nature of the services and set out the terms and conditions governing the relationship between the parties.

#### Consulting

We provide tailored strategic advice and expert guidance on urban design, landscape planning, artificial intelligence, and inclusive governance. Our consulting services bridge academic knowledge with practical applications, helping organizations navigate change and innovation responsibly.  

#### Communication

We help disseminate knowledge and results to diverse audiences through publications, exhibitions, workshops, training, and public events. By combining academic rigor with accessible formats, we ensure that research outcomes reach communities, policymakers, and professionals alike.
