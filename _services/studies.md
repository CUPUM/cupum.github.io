### We provide various courses in urban design and theory open to local and international students  

Since 2003, the mission of the UNESCO Chair has been to build bridges between the University of Montréal, UNESCO, their partner organizations, and international stakeholders.  

By providing training in a global context, the UNESCO Chair fosters new forms of exchange and collaboration through education and capacity-building.  

#### 1. MSc in Urban Design

The Master of Science in Urban Design offers advanced training in the theory and practice of urban design. It emphasizes sustainable, inclusive, and climate-resilient approaches to transforming cities and regions. Students engage in design studios, seminars, and fieldwork, often linked to the Chair’s international research and partnerships.  

#### 2. Graduate course *Datathink*

*Datathink* is a graduate-level seminar that critically examines the role of data and artificial intelligence in shaping cities. Students learn to analyze digital technologies from a social, political, and ethical perspective while experimenting with data-driven methods for urban design and governance. The course combines lectures, discussions, and applied exercises.  

#### 3. UNESCO Studio

The UNESCO Studio is an intensive international workshop where students collaborate with peers, local communities, and partner institutions to address real-world urban challenges. Past studios have taken place in cities such as Phnom Penh, Hanoi, New Orleans, and Montreal. Each edition blends research, design, and community engagement, culminating in public exhibitions or publications that showcase the outcomes.
