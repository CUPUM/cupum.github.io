### We welcome research and design interns

As part of our mission, we have been hosting international and local research and design interns across all fields of planning, design, social science and engineering. Here, you find some information about why do an internship at the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape, how to become an intern and what your internship will be like.

#### Why choose the UNESCO Chair for your research or design internship

Interns at the Chair join an internationally recognized research environment that bridges academia, practice, and policy. You will work alongside experts on pressing issues such as sustainable urbanism, biodiversity, social inclusion, and artificial intelligence for cities. Our projects are multidisciplinary and often involve collaborations with municipalities, NGOs, design firms, and international organizations, offering a unique opportunity to contribute to real-world impact.  

#### How to become an intern  

Prospective interns should contact the Chairholder with a CV, a short statement of interest, and, if relevant, a portfolio of work. Candidates may also apply through their university’s internship program or via agreements established with our international partners. All internships must comply with the University of Montréal’s policies and require formal approval. Positions are limited and competitive, and applicants are encouraged to apply well in advance.  

#### What will the internship be like

Internships typically range from 8 to 16 weeks, depending on academic requirements and project needs. Interns are integrated into ongoing research and design projects, where they may contribute to data collection and analysis, design development, fieldwork, public engagement activities, and knowledge dissemination. Supervision is provided by faculty and researchers of the Chair, ensuring a balance of guidance and autonomy. Interns are encouraged to develop their own initiative within the scope of the project, gain exposure to interdisciplinary teamwork, and present their contributions at internal seminars or public events.
