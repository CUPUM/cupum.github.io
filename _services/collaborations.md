### We are always open for exciting collaborations and partnerships that align with our mission.
We strongly believe that urban landscapes are better made together, and that interdisciplinary and intersectoral collaboration leads to innovative solutions for cities' most pressing challenges.

As per our mission, we develop, transmit and valorize knowledge to the benefit of humanity and the natural environment. We are bound to do so by collaborating with researchers, practitioners, policy-makers and citizens across forms of knowledge.

We address both local and global issues, and wish to do so in many ways:

#### 1. Research
We develop fundamental and applied research in the fields of architecture, urban planning, landscape architecture, design, geography, political science and computer science.

To collaborate over research projects, big or small, don't hesitate to reach out and tell us about your work. 

#### 2. Teaching
We teach courses in architecture, landscape architecture, urban planning, and urban design & theory. This includes seminars, studios and workshops at the undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate levels.

Get in touch with our team to launch collaborative courses, joint programs or exchange agreements.

#### 3. Valorization
We advocate for greater sustainability and social inclusion in cities. To do so, we rely on various scientific, institutional and professional networks and organizations.

Let's join forces and help out the world become a better place.
