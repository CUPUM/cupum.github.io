# Producing and transmitting knowledge on cities’ ecological, social and digital transitions 
The UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape of the University of Montreal contributes to research and education on cities, supporting and raising awareness among elected officials and municipal experts, governments, and citizens for the future of their landscapes and quality of life within urban settings. Through the implementation of its objectives, the Chair builds bridges between the academic world, civil society, local communities, research, and political decisions. Thereby, it participates to a sustainable development of cities and urban territories around the world.

The Chair develops research, educational, and valorisation projects in collaboration with UNESCO and the University of Montréal, and partners engaged in sustainable development, responsible artificial intelligence, inclusive policy-making and international cooperation.   

The Chair’s team gathers career and student researchers and educators with expertise spanning across design, the human and social science, natural sciences, engineering and education. Most team-members are located in Montréal, and bind with multiple professional, scientific, academic and technical networks spanning across the globe.

Our offices are located on unceded indigenous territory within the Environmental Design Building of the University of Montréal's Mountain campus.


Mohamed Amine Abbou (he/him)

Holder of a master’s degree in architecture from the University of Science and Technology of Oran (Algeria), the urban project for which Amine opted on during the last year of the urban planning program allowed him to be initiated to a large scale, to the metropolitan space and its stakes, exceeding the built framework he is used to as an architect. Governance, citizen participation and sustainable development are the issues on which he wanted to work on, but his country did not offer the space propice for learning, studying urban planning abroad was therefore an opportunity for him to open up to the world and allow his city to benefit from the expertise he is accumulating. The University of Montreal responded perfectly to his quest for multidisciplinarity, diversity, and innovation in terms of development.

Toumader’s work crosses the theories of the sensitive and of interbreeding. She questions the impact of migratory movements in the Mediterranean on the “ambiences” and on the sensitive future of urban spaces.She also looks into different methods of characterizing the urban mainly those allocated to the approaches: sensitive, historical, and syntactic.

He then joined the firm Dark Matter Labs, where he led various projects in public governance, urban planning regulations and environmental finance. In 2019, he co-founded the Nouveaux Voisins organization, which aims to transform imagining, planting and promoting landscapes rich in biodiversity. Emile can be find camouflaged in gardens of native plants reflecting on urban ecology strategies, imagining our relationship to nature in the city in a different way.
