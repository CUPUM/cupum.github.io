The UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape is pleased to announce that NULAB, the project for digital knowledge, has been selected by the Vice-Rectorate for Student Affairs and Studies of the University of Montreal to receive a funding worth $24,351.

This community of practice project will have the mission of responding to the learning challenges relating to digital tools. It will act as an information centre, for sharing knowledge and best practices, and as a social, technical and material resource.

This project falls under the initiative program for success 2023-2024. It was submitted in partnership with the School of Urban Planning and Landscape Architecture of the University of Montreal, as well as the Association of Graduate Studies in Planning (ACSA).
