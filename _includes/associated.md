Associated projects are collaborative initiatives in which the UNESCO Chair participates as an active co-researcher. They are typically aligned with one or more of our research axes and are supported by academic or governmental funding agencies. By engaging as co-investigators, we contribute expertise, networks, and methodological innovation, while benefitting from diverse perspectives and disciplinary approaches. These projects enrich our own research agenda, expand the scope of our impact, and strengthen partnerships across institutions. Associated projects demonstrate the UNESCO Chairâ€™s commitment to shared leadership and the co-production of knowledge that addresses complex, multi-scalar challenges facing contemporary cities and landscapes.
