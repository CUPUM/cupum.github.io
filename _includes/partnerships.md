Rooted in a community-focused and intersectoral approach, these initiatives foster dialogue across disciplines and sectors while valuing creativity and research-creation as drivers of knowledge. They are built to address pressing global challenges at the intersection of our research axes by acknowledging the complexity today's challenges and the need for collective action. By mobilizing diverse expertise and perspectives, partnership projects generate innovative, inclusive, and transformative solutions that extend beyond academia to have tangible impacts on society and the environment.
