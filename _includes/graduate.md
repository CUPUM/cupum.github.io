Graduate projects are research endeavors led by master’s and doctoral students under the direction or co-direction of the UNESCO Chair. They are embedded within our research axes and reflect our commitment to community-focused, intersectoral, and creative inquiry. These projects often culminate in a thesis or dissertation, advancing both academic knowledge and real-world practice. By engaging students in research-creation processes, graduate projects provide valuable training opportunities while contributing to the UNESCO Chair’s broader mission. They represent a vital bridge between education and impact, empowering the next generation of scholars and practitioners to address complex social, ecological, and technological challenges.
