Affiliated projects are those in which the UNESCO Chair contributes as collaborator, advisor, or expert partner. While not led by us, these projects resonate with our mission and research axes, and we provide strategic input, critical reflection, or methodological support. Through affiliations, the UNESCO Chair strengthens international and intersectoral connections, fosters the exchange of knowledge, and helps translate research into practice. Affiliated projects allow us to support promising initiatives that extend beyond our direct leadership, ensuring that our expertise informs a broader range of community-focused, creative, and intersectoral efforts to shape sustainable and inclusive urban and ecological futures.
