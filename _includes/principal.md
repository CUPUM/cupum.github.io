Principal projects are initiated and led by the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape. They embody our philosophy of being community-focused, intersectoral, and creative, while contributing directly to one or more of our three research axes: biodiversity, social inclusion, and digitization. Funded by major granting agencies, government bodies, or institutions, these projects advance both fundamental and applied knowledge. They generate innovative practices, policy insights, and design tools that strengthen our collective capacity to respond to urgent urban and ecological challenges, while also positioning the UNESCO Chair as a leader in research-creation for sustainable and inclusive urban futures.
