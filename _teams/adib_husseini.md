During his studies in Architecture, Adib got interested in revitalizing marginalized and lost spaces by the industrial development and the mechanization of society in some cities on the coast of Lebanon, and focused on putting these public spaces back on the map, at the service of the population. Currently enrolled in a masterâ€™s degree in urban planning at the University of Montreal, he joined the team of research assistants of the UNESCO chair to study the impact of 5G on the city of Montreal.
