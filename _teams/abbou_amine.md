Holder of a masterâ€™s degree in architecture from the University of Science and Technology of Oran (Algeria), the urban project for which Amine opted on during the last year of the urban planning program allowed him to be initiated to a large scale, to the metropolitan space and its stakes, exceeding the built framework he is used to as an architect. Governance, citizen participation and sustainable development are the issues on which he wanted to work on, but his country did not offer the space propice for learning, studying urban planning abroad was therefore an opportunity for him to open up to the world and allow his city to benefit from the expertise he is accumulating. The University of Montreal responded perfectly to his quest for multidisciplinarity, diversity, and innovation in terms of development.
