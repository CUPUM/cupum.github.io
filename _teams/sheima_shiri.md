Holder of a bachelor’s degree in geography with a concentration in land use planning at UQÀM, Sheïma is interested in the processes of revitalization of neglected urban spaces. She is also the winner of a prize for best development project aimed at revitalizing the village core of the municipality of Pointes-aux-Trembles, as part of the Grands projets urbains course at UQÀM. Beyond urban revitalization, Sheïma has also dealt with the notion of environmental injustice and the impact of heat islands in Montreal North as part of a research work supervised by Sylvain Lefevre. Currently a master’s student in urban planning at the University of Montreal, her thesis focuses on resilient developments in the context of flood-prone areas, under the supervision of Isabelle Thomas. As part of her work at the chair, Sheïma studies the impact of the installation of 5G antennas on the island of Montreal and the effect of these installations on the urban landscape.
