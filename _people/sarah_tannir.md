Sarah earned her Bachelor’s degree in Landscape Architecture (B.LA) from the American University of Beirut (AUB), in Lebanon. After working as a research assistant on various social projects aimed at promoting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), she decided to pursue her master’s degree in Environmental Design (M.Sc.A) at the University of Montreal. For her research project, developed at the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape, and with the support of OBVIA (The International Observatory on the Societal Impacts of AI and Digital Technology), Sarah will explore how the rise of Artificial Intelligence in urban environments will impact citizens’ wellbeing; and most particularly their mental health. Through her study, she hopes to destigmatize the topic of mental illness in urban discourse.
