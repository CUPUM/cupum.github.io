It was while tirelessly traveling Route 132 and Highway 20, between Montreal and Bonaventure, that Emile developed a fascination for landscapes and the people who inhabit them. As soon as he can, he begins to scribble maps of these territories crossed, as much on napkins as on plywood boards.

Trained in architecture, urban planning and sociology of landscapes, he worked between 2015 and 2020 for lâ€™Enclume, a territorial development workspace. He then joined the firm Dark Matter Labs, where he led various projects in public governance, urban planning regulations and environmental finance. In 2019, he co-founded the Nouveaux Voisins organization, which aims to transform imagining, planting and promoting landscapes rich in biodiversity. Emile can be find camouflaged in gardens of native plants reflecting on urban ecology strategies, imagining our relationship to nature in the city in a different way.
