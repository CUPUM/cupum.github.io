This project aims to define inclusive design options and guidelines for the visual identity of 5G antennas in the urban environment in Montreal. Seen as the key to the future of telecommunications, the implementation of the 5G network will involve the deployment of thousands of antennas to ensure uninterrupted connectivity to users. The harmonious integration of these antennas into the urban landscape requires careful consideration given their significant visual impact.
In Montreal, the city and telecommunications operators have reached agreements to use street furniture, such as traffic light barrels, to install micro-cells as part of the preliminary deployment of 5G in the city.
To ensure more inclusive landscape integration, this project aims to present specific landscape integration options for the city of Montreal. The objective is to respond to the visual challenges posed by the massive deployment of 5G antennas, while taking into account existing agreements, urban issues, and aesthetic concerns specific to the city.
