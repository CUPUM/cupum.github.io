The UNESCO Phnom Penh Studio is a research-creation workshop held from May 13 to 24 in Cambodia. It initiated a reflection on improving the quality of life in the urban areas along the Mekong River in the Cambodian capital, which are currently experiencing rapid real estate development.

The project offered international training opportunities and intercultural collaboration to 39 students from Canada, Cambodia, and Thailand. It also fostered cooperation among researchers from six universities: the Royal University of Fine Arts (Cambodia), the University of Law and Economics (Cambodia), the Royal University of Phnom Penh (Cambodia), Norton University (Cambodia), and King Mongkut’s University of Technology Thonburi (Thailand). Through the workshop, a series of 11 lectures highlighted the work of local researchers, professionals, and organizations. At the opening of the exhibition in Phnom Penh, the networking of stakeholders contributed to the creation of a network of actors involved in the development of the Mekong riverbanks.

A traditional Apsara dance performance during the opening showcased intangible heritage while promoting the values of diversity, equity, and inclusion, particularly within the LGBTQ+ community. The event, which welcomed more than 80 guests, was broadcast on the platforms of the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape, thereby increasing its visibility.

## Numbers

### 10 neighborhoods

The UNESCO Studio develops community-centered urban design projects for 10 neighborhoods located alongside the Mekong River in Phnom Penh.

### 65 collaborators

Sixty-five academics, professionals, representatives from international and local organizations, and local authorities collaborate to the UNESCO Studio through lectures and meetings with participants.

### 5 countries’ expertise

The UNESCO Studio brings together student-researchers, academics and professionals from five countries: Cambodia, Thailand, Singapore, the United States, and Canada.

### 39 trained young professionals across fields

From May 13-24, 2024, the UNESCO Studio trains 39 young professionals in architecture, design, economics, law, urban planning. Coming from six different universities across three countries, these young professionals are thus completing their training with a unique international and interdisciplinary experience.

### 2 exhibitions on 2 continents

The UNESCO Studio leads to the creation of the exhibition Phnom Penh Against the Current, presented both in Phnom Penh and in Montreal. The exhibition showcases the results of a sensory ethnographic study and 10 design projects developed to enhance the quality of life along the Mekong River. Phnom Penh Against the Current welcomes over 60 guests on each of its opening nights, reflecting strong community interest and engagement with the studio’s work.

## Impacts

### Innovative design projects for neighborhoods

The UNESCO Studio Phnom Penh works on improving the quality of life in ten neighborhoods along the Mekong River. The teams explore these urban areas in depth and create context-sensitive design strategies while engaging local stakeholders throughout the process. During the research-creation workshop, participants produce detailed visualizations and design concepts that reflect both analytical understanding of urban contexts and creative thinking.  

### Interdisciplinary and intersectoral collaboration

The studio brings together academics, professionals, civil society organizations, and local authorities to exchange knowledge and perspectives. This collaboration builds a deeper understanding of urban challenges and strengthens inclusive, cross-sector planning processes.

### International partnership

The studio fosters long-term international partnerships by addressing shared urban challenges. It connects countries and institutions during the workshop, but through ongoing relationships that continue to grow beyond the project.  

## Training 

The UNESCO Studio trains 39 graduate students from six universities in Cambodia, Thailand and Canada: the Royal University of Fine Arts, the University of Law and Economics, the Royal University of Phnom Penh, Norton University, Kong Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, and the University of Montréal. Students take part in hands-on studio work and attend 11 conferences featuring local and international experts.

## Outreach

The studio hosts two exhibitions to share its outcomes. On May 24, 2024, the Royal University of Fine Arts in Phnom Penh presents the first exhibition, where participants display their design work and spark conversations about urban sustainability. The event includes a performance by members of អមោឃបាស – The Next Generation, who celebrate Khmer classical dance, intangible heritage, and LGBTQ+ inclusion. From October 10-17, 2024, the University of Montréal hosts the second exhibition, extending the project’s reach to a wider community. The UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape broadens the visibility and public engagement of both events across social media platforms (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn and Bluesky).

During his career Vann Molyvann designs infrastructure and monuments for Cambodia. Now known as “New Khmer architecture”, his style is a distinctive blend of traditional Khmer design with modernist principles, inspired by Le Corbusier. During 1956 to 1970, Vann Molyvann completed more than 100 projects across Cambodia. He is remembered and celebrated today as a symbol of Cambodian design.
