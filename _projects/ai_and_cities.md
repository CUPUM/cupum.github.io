The AI & Cities partnership is an international initiative dedicated to exploring and guiding the responsible integration of artificial intelligence into urban governance and development. At a time when cities are rapidly adopting digital tools, the partnership seeks to ensure that these technologies are aligned with social needs, ecological priorities, and democratic values. It positions cities not only as adopters of AI, but as active leaders in defining how AI can be designed and governed for the common good.

Bringing together universities, municipalities, NGOs, companies, and international organizations, the partnership operates as a platform for interdisciplinary collaboration. Researchers contribute technical expertise, city administrations provide real-world contexts, and civil society groups ensure that diverse voices are represented. By weaving these perspectives together, the partnership develops practical tools, policy frameworks, and educational programs that help local governments make informed and ethical decisions about AI deployment.

The initiative also emphasizes equity and inclusion as central to the future of urban AI. From participatory workshops with citizens, to collaborative pilots with city departments, the partnership prioritizes transparency, accessibility, and accountability. Its projects range from testing AI tools for urban planning and climate adaptation, to creating governance models that safeguard rights and foster trust. Through these efforts, the AI & Cities partnership aims to shape a global conversation on how urban communities can harness AI for sustainable, just, and resilient futures.
