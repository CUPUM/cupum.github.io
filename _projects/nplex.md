Nplex is a web-application promoting the exemplarity of design and architecture around Montreal. It showcases design excellence through the works of local designers and artisans of affordable and responsible _modest_ projects. It aims to fulfill various complementary missions, ranging from educating citizens about best design practices in their area to providing a channel for architects, designers, and planners who want to expose their work and making it easier to find useful local resources and competent individuals in the field of design.

Nplex lists "exemplary small design projects" conceived and realized by local professionals. From kitchens and esplanades to gardens and balconies, the catalog highlights local excellence and provides information on best practices for modest renovation and construction projects. The selection of projects featured in Nplex is based on the criteria of its Exemplarity Guide and its core principles derived from the _2030 Montreal Agenda_: _sustainability_, _resilience_, _moderation of energy consumption_, _economic optimization_, _attractiveness and cultural enhancement_, _innovation_, _equity and inclusiveness_, and _well-being_.

Nplex is an initiative of the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape of the University of Montreal, and is realized with the support of the Bureau du design de la Ville de Montréal and the Fonds Sid Lee Architecture.
